Abusive Text detector - by Kingsley Chimezie
---------------------------------------------

My program is intended to allow a user to check a text file 
for any abusive words. The users text file is compared with
a second text file containing a library of bad words. 
any words found would be displayed.

Users can also remove and add to the library.
